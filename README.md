Project Name: Portfolio for Coding
This project aims to create a portfolio for coding that will showcase the work samples of a potential employee. The portfolio is designed to satisfy a typical hiring manager's needs by presenting the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.

User Story
As an employer, I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples so that I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

Acceptance Criteria
When the portfolio is loaded, the employer is presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
When a link in the navigation is clicked, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
When the link to the section about the developer's work is clicked, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.
When presented with the developer's first application, that application's image is larger in size than the others.
When an employer clicks on the images of the applications, they are taken to that deployed application.
When resizing the page or viewing the site on various screens and devices, the employer is presented with a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport.
